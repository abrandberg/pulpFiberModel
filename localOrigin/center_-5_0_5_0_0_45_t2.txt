! This is the first part of the extension from modelling single fibers to 
! modelling bond crosses and entire networks. Basically, this file tells
! where the center of the fiber should be:
!
xOrigin = -5
yOrigin = yMaxTemp+Rin+Tkn+1
zOrigin = 5
thxyOrigin = 0
thyzOrigin = 0
thzxOrigin = 45

csys,0
clocal,cCounter+1,0,xOrigin,yOrigin,zOrigin,thxyOrigin,thyzOrigin,thzxOrigin
csys,0
clocal,cCounter+2,1,xOrigin,yOrigin,zOrigin,thxyOrigin,thyzOrigin,thzxOrigin
csys,0                                                                     ! Go back to the standard coordinate system before doing anything else, just in case.

cCounter = cCounter + 2
